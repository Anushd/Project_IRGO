# Project_IRGO

Project IRGO is a novel approach to the autonomous vehicle focusing on cost-efficiency and easy-to-implement technology. This
concept places full control of the autonomous vehicle in controllers in the road rather than the vehicle itself, thereby
yielding a "dummy" vehicle which follows instructions from an external source. The vehicle is continuously fed navigational data
via infrared transmitters embedded in the road as it navigates. To improve accuracy and reliability of the vehicle, computer
vision has also been implemented in order to detect pedestrians and other obstructions as well as to keep the vehicle in
alignment with the lane. These mechanisms have been replaced with sophisticated equipment which is normally required of autonous
vehicles, thereby reducing cost as well as viability. The road-embedded controller has been designed based on the fluid dynamics of a newtonian liquid in order to minimize traffic. The development process has been documented here http://projectirgo.blogspot.in.
